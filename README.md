# Developer Approach
The programming language used to solve this challenge has been Java 18 with Spring Boot framework,
and Maven for project building.

### Data storage of cars and journeys
Due to the large amount of Cars and Journeys (up to 10‚Åµ), I have used an embedded Redis database to 
keep a good performance, and Lettuce as the connector because it is thread-safe.

A great advantage of Redis and Hashes is that most commands are O(1), so, even to get more performance,
I have split the Hashes collections depending on the available seats to avoid searching
in a Hash where I already know that there is no enough available seats. However, all the
journeys introduced are stored in the same Hash because I do not see any reason to split them.

A disadvantage of Hashes is that they are stored without any order, they are collections of 
field-value pairs. So, for this basic approach, I assume that cars should not follow any order,
the priority are the groups of people that can find a car with enough available seats.

However, the order of arrival of the groups must be kept, so when a group of people request a car
and there is no car with enough seats available, I use a Redis list to create a "waiting list" only for those
waiting groups.



### Dispatching cars for groups of people
First, if a group of people arrives and there is a car available, then that car is assigned 
to the group. But if there is no car available, I have implemented a "priority algorithm" that only
assign a car if some drop-offs have been reached depending on the size of the car fleet.

This approach, although it is very simple, allows to give more priority to the first waiting group,
because maybe there is a group of 5 people waiting and it is harder to assign a car for them,
than assign a car only for 1 person.

So, for example, if there is a fleet of 10 cars, that size is multiplied by a constant of 0.3, so the
drop-off limit is 3. If there is a first group of 5 people waiting for a car, that group has the priority during 
a maximum of 3 tries, if after this, a car is not yet available, then the "blocking state" is broken and now all
the waiting list is checked to find a group that could be served. Furthermore, if while the waiting list is being 
checked, the next following groups cannot be served, they are also penalized adding a "waiting weight".

### Tests
Some unit test using JUint 5 have been implemented to check that the API REST methods are correct, and that
the "priority algorithm" works perfectly.

### Documentation
All the code is documented using Javadoc. The index.html is located in the "javadoc" directory.

### Logging
Loggin has been implemented with Logback.

### Improvements
A great improvement would be to implement an "age queue" for the car fleet, to give more
priority to those cars that have not been assigned to a group of people for a longer period.
In this way, drivers would be happier because all of them will earn some money and the work
would be better distributed.

# Car Pooling Service Challenge

Design/implement a system to manage car pooling.

At Cabify we provide the service of taking people from point A to point B.
So far we have done it without sharing cars with multiple groups of people.
This is an opportunity to optimize the use of resources by introducing car
pooling.

You have been assigned to build the car availability service that will be used
to track the available seats in cars.

Cars have a different amount of seats available, they can accommodate groups of
up to 4, 5 or 6 people.

People requests cars in groups of 1 to 6. People in the same group want to ride
on the same car. You can take any group at any car that has enough empty seats
for them. If it's not possible to accommodate them, they're willing to wait until 
there's a car available for them. Once a car is available for a group
that is waiting, they should ride. 

Once they get a car assigned, they will journey until the drop off, you cannot
ask them to take another car (i.e. you cannot swap them to another car to
make space for another group).

In terms of fairness of trip order: groups should be served as fast as possible,
but the arrival order should be kept when possible.
If group B arrives later than group A, it can only be served before group A
if no car can serve group A.

For example: a group of 6 is waiting for a car and there are 4 empty seats at
a car for 6; if a group of 2 requests a car you may take them in the car.
This may mean that the group of 6 waits a long time,
possibly until they become frustrated and leave.

## Evaluation rules

This challenge has a partially automated scoring system. This means that before
it is seen by the evaluators, it needs to pass a series of automated checks
and scoring.

### Checks

All checks need to pass in order for the challenge to be reviewed.

- The `acceptance` test step in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` must pass in master before you
submit your solution. We will not accept any solutions that do not pass or omit
this step. This is a public check that can be used to assert that other tests 
will run successfully on your solution. **This step needs to run without 
modification**
- _"further tests"_ will be used to prove that the solution works correctly. 
These are not visible to you as a candidate and will be run once you submit 
the solution

### Scoring

There is a number of scoring systems being run on your solution after it is 
submitted. It is ok if these do not pass, but they add information for the
reviewers.

## API

To simplify the challenge and remove language restrictions, this service must
provide a REST API which will be used to interact with it.

This API must comply with the following contract:

### GET /status

Indicate the service has started up correctly and is ready to accept requests.

Responses:

* **200 OK** When the service is ready to receive requests.

### PUT /cars

Load the list of available cars in the service and remove all previous data
(reset the application state). This method may be called more than once during
the life cycle of the service.

**Body** _required_ The list of cars to load.

**Content Type** `application/json`

Sample:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "seats": 4
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "seats": 6
  }
]
```

Responses:

* **200 OK** When the list is registered correctly.
* **400 Bad Request** When there is a failure in the request format, expected
  headers, or the payload can't be unmarshalled.

### POST /journey

A group of people requests to perform a journey.

**Body** _required_ The group of people that wants to perform the journey

**Content Type** `application/json`

Sample:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "people": 4
}
```

Responses:

* **200 OK** or **202 Accepted** When the group is registered correctly
* **400 Bad Request** When there is a failure in the request format or the
  payload can't be unmarshalled.

### POST /dropoff

A group of people requests to be dropped off. Whether they traveled or not.

**Body** _required_ A form with the group ID, such that `ID=X`

**Content Type** `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

Responses:

* **200 OK** or **204 No Content** When the group is unregistered correctly.
* **404 Not Found** When the group is not to be found.
* **400 Bad Request** When there is a failure in the request format or the
  payload can't be unmarshalled.

### POST /locate

Given a group ID such that `ID=X`, return the car the group is traveling
with, or no car if they are still waiting to be served.

**Body** _required_ A url encoded form with the group ID such that `ID=X`

**Content Type** `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

**Accept** `application/json`

Responses:

* **200 OK** With the car as the payload when the group is assigned to a car. See below for the expected car representation 
```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "seats": 4
  }
```

* **204 No Content** When the group is waiting to be assigned to a car.
* **404 Not Found** When the group is not to be found.
* **400 Bad Request** When there is a failure in the request format or the
  payload can't be unmarshalled.

## Tooling

At Cabify, we use Gitlab and Gitlab CI for our backend development work. 
In this repo you may find a [.gitlab-ci.yml](./.gitlab-ci.yml) file which
contains some tooling that would simplify the setup and testing of the
deliverable. This testing can be enabled by simply uncommenting the final
acceptance stage. Note that the image build should be reproducible within
the CI environment.

Additionally, you will find a basic Dockerfile which you could use a
baseline, be sure to modify it as much as needed, but keep the exposed port
as is to simplify the testing.

:warning: Avoid dependencies and tools that would require changes to the 
`acceptance` step of [.gitlab-ci.yml](./.gitlab-ci.yml), such as 
`docker-compose`

:warning: The challenge needs to be self-contained so we can evaluate it. 
If the language you are using has limitations that block you from solving this 
challenge without using a database, please document your reasoning in the 
readme and use an embedded one such as sqlite.

You are free to use whatever programming language you deem is best to solve the
problem but please bear in mind we want to see your best!

You can ignore the Gitlab warning "Cabify Challenge has exceeded its pipeline 
minutes quota," it will not affect your test or the ability to run pipelines on
Gitlab.

## Requirements

- The service should be as efficient as possible.
  It should be able to work reasonably well with at least $`10^4`$ / $`10^5`$ cars / waiting groups.
  Explain how you did achieve this requirement.
- You are free to modify the repository as much as necessary to include or remove
  dependencies, subject to tooling limitations above.
- Document your decisions using MRs or in this very README adding sections to it,
  the same way you would be generating documentation for any other deliverable.
  We want to see how you operate in a quasi real work environment.
